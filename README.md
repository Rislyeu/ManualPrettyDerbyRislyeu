Starting Rules:
10 random R cards
2 random "1* Beginner Umas"
1 Scenario "URA Scenario"
1 Career Unlock "1* Beginner Uma Careers"

Items are other Umas, 1 2 and 3* as defined by the yaml.
Support Cards, R, SR, SSR
Skill Points, calculated to be able to buy skills eventually
Career Wins for 3* Umas, win condition currently win with all chosen 3*s

Locations are all Uma's career goals, all URA Finals race types and then the victory location which is beating all 3* Uma Careers.

Uma career goals logiced by region, having 5 tiers: 1* Beginner, 1* Expert, 2* Beginner, 2* Expert, and 3*.
Each region requires an Uma of that type, also with the unlocked generic career unlock of those tier of Umas.

Yaml options are simply a list of all 3*s currently in EN, with a true/false of including them in generation.  Umas are categorized to have their career wins, their uma item and all their career goal locations to be toggled by these options.

I probably forgot something.
