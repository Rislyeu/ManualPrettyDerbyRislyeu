Umamusume: Pretty Derby Randomizer Manual

This Manual is intended for use with existing Umamusume: Pretty Derby accounts, using whatever Umas and Support Cards you have already obtained on your account and mixing them with everything else.

For best experience when beginning a randomizer of this Manual, it is recommended to make 2-4 “garbage” parents, that is parents that do not train and have low stats and little sparks, to more accurately put the level of your account lower then the progress you have already made on your account.  This means that any uma you make while playing the randomizer will likely be your best parents throughout your run. while playing, by marking them with a unique favorite symbol. 

Every location is winning (or participating in) the various Uma’s career goals, starting with two unlocked 1 star ‘easy’ umas and 10 R rarity Support cards and the item that permits 1 star easy uma careers.

Items will unlock other Umas along with items to allow higher level Uma careers to be attempted.  Logic works that there are designated 1 star ‘easy’ umas, then 1 stars, then 2 star ‘easy’ umas, then 2 stars, then 3 stars as a group.  Other items will give you access to more total Skill Points on each career and also a couple of luxury options (Alarm Clocks and Guest Uma Borrows).

The goal currently is to simply finish all career goals on a certain number of 3 star umas as set in your yaml options.
When setting up your yaml, you can turn on any 3 star Uma that you have obtained on your account. Keep in mind that if you select an Uma you do not have access to, their races will show up in your randomizer and items will be locked behind goals you cannot accomplish.

Every Support Card is currently in every iteration of the randomizer.  My logic behind this is that every career run you are required to borrow a Support card so getting an early SSR Support card even if you do not own it is a large boon to your career races by simply looking up someone else that has that card and borrowing it for yourself.  If you do not know about it, there is a handy site where you can look up a player that has a particular Support Card and can friend them to borrow that specific card.
